Classifying Images of different sizes acquired from a RGB-D sensor. Image characteristics:

No color information provided
A few pixels report depth measures
Images belong to 3 classes:
* ENVELOPE
* PARCEL
* DOUBLE


Goal:

Train a CNN able to classify these images in the three classes.
Possibly compare the CNN performance with an hand-crafted classifier
