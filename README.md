The following project was carried out for the course IMAGE ANALYSIS AND COMPUTER VISION.

The scope is to classify Images of different sizes acquired from a RGB-D sensor.

No color information provided and few pixels report depth measures.

Images belong to 3 classes:
* ENVELOPE
* PARCEL
* DOUBLE

Plus an extra class:
* OTHER

Goal:

Train a CNN able to classify these images in the three classes.
Possibly compare the CNN performance with an hand-crafted classifier
